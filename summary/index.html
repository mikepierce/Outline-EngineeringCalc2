    Sometimes the purpose of a course 
    becomes obfuscated over its duration;
    it can become hard to appreciate the overarching plot of a story 
    when one spends months buried in fine exposition
    and occasional side-plots.
    This narrative overview, in its brevity, 
    serves to summarize the plot of this course
    and to clarify our purpose,
    for the sake of keeping both student and instructor 
    focused on what’s important.

<h2>Transcendental Functions</h2>
<p>
    In this second semester of calculus
    we finally come around to introducing the transcendental functions
    \(\ln(x)\) and \(\mathrm{e}^x\).
</p>
<aside>
    Although it should be pointed out, 
    the trigonometric functions sine, tangent, secant, etc,
    are <em>also</em> transcendental functions;
    the designers of most calculus textbooks subtitled “late transcendentals”
    don’t appear to be bothered by this.
</aside>
<p>
    We introduce these functions by <em>defining</em>
    the (natural) logarithm as a definite integral
    \[ \ln(x) = \int\limits_1^x \frac{1}{t}\,\mathrm{d}t\,, \]
    and from there defining \(\mathrm{e}^x\) as \(\ln^{-1}(x)\).
    After starting from this perspective though,
    it becomes pertinent to figure out how the derivative 
    of the inverse of a function relates the function itself.
    Luckily the relationship is quite simple.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Know that the derivative of the inverse of a function 
        can be expressed in terms of the derivative of that function as
        \[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f^{-1}(x) = 
        \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}\,. \]
        This is known as the <em>inverse function theorem</em>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can get a lot of information from the inverse function theorem,
    not just about the derivative of \(\mathrm{e}^x\)
    and about exponential/logarithmic function of non-natural bases,
    but also about the inverses of trigonometric functions.
    This information adds to our toolbox 
    of differentiation and integrations skills.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to calculate the derivative of 
        any rational sum, product, or composite
        of exponential or logarithmic functions of any base,
        and of inverse trigonometric functions:
        arcsine, arctangent, arcsecant, etc.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to calculate the antiderivative 
        of any rational sum of exponential functions, 
        or any antiderivative involving an exponential
        that yields to substitution.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Recognize the patterns of the derivatives
        of logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions
        when they appear as integrands
        so as to calculate integrals when they appear.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Beyond that core thread of new skills, 
    we explore two miscellaneous skills
    that required the language of logarithms 
    to develop in their entirety.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be familiar with the technique of 
        <em>logarithmic differentiation</em>,
        and know that this technique is essential
        to calculate the derivative of functions of the form
        \(f(x)^{g(x)}\) for non-constant \(f\) and \(g\).
        Explicitly as a formula,
        \[
        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left(f(x)^{g(x)}\right)
        = f(x)^{g(x)}\left(g(x)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} 
        + g'(x)\ln\big(f(x)\big) \right).
        \]
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Know how and when to apply <em>L’Hospital’s Rule</em>
        to investigate the value of a limit.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before we conclude our exploration of transcendental functions
    and move on to a new chapter of the story,
    there is one last sight we really should see,
    just to say we saw it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Be <em>familiar</em> with hyperbolic trigonometric functions:
        what they are, how they relate to exponential functions,
        and what their derivatives and antiderivatives look like.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The addition of these logarithmic, exponential, 
    trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions
    completes the dictionary of differentiable functions
    we’ve been building in this class,
    and so we are now well-prepared to dive into 
    the art and practice of evaluating integrals.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Techniques &amp; Applications of Integration</h2>
<p>
    We’ve seen already that its more complicated
    to calculate antiderivative than derivatives.
    Now we dip our toes into this complication.
    Now begins the gauntlet. 
</p>
<p>
    We know already that integrals are linear:
    they break up across sums and constants factor out.
    We also know to recognize a few integrals on sight
    simply as being the derivatives of familiar functions.
    And we have a single tool for computing derivatives, 
    <em>substitution</em>, which “undoes” the chain-rule of differentiation.
    The first new tool we’ll develop in this class 
    is called <em>integration by-parts</em>,
    a way of “undoing” the product-rule of differentiation.
    The essence of integration by-parts is the formula,
    \[ \int u \,\mathrm{d}v = uv - \int v \,\mathrm{d}u\,, \]
</p>
<p>
    With this tool we’ll finally be able to calculate 
    formulas for the integrals
    \[
        \int \ln(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \int \sec(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
    \]
    and move on to learning the tricks for dealing with 
    more complicated trigonometric integrands like these:
    \[
        \int \sin^n(x)\cos^m(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
        \quad
        \int \sec^n(x)\tan^m(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
        \quad
        \int \sin(ax)\cos(bx)\,\mathrm{d}x
    \]
    The “trick” is to be able to fluently wield trigonometric identities
    to rewrite the integrands, particularly the Pythagorean identities
    \[
        cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1
        \qquad
        1 + \tan^2(x) = sec^2(x)  
    \]
    along with the double/half-angle formulas 
    and the product-to-sum formulas.
    And this is a good trick; 
    we get extra mileage out of those two Pythagorean identities
    due to their ability to turn a sum/difference of squares
    into a single square term, a technique known as 
    <em>trigonometric substitution</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The last technique of integration we’ll cover
    isn’t so much about integration
    as it is about writing a rational function
    as a sum of smaller rational functions.
    This sum is called its <em>partial fraction decomposition</em>.
    To take the integral of a rational functions
    it’s much easier to take the integral of 
    these smaller summands individually.
    While learning these we see that it also pays
    be generally be adept at algebraic manipulations 
    while integrating functions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to employ any of the previous tools/techniques
        to calculate formulas for indefinite integrals.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This concludes the gauntlet 
    of learning to manually compute some integrals,
    so we should check back in with reality.
    Not every integrals is computable.
    I.e. not every integral can be expressed as a formula
    in terms of elementary functions.
    In practice when we need to compute the value
    of a definite integral we can use a computer
    to approximate it to arbitrary precision.
    We’ve already talked about Riemann sums
    and the midpoint rule and the trapezoid rule, 
    but there are other methods.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concepts</h4>
        Be <em>familiar</em> with techniques 
        of numerically computing definite integrals,
        particularly with the trapezoid rule 
        and with Newton–Cotes formulas of higher degree,
        and the bounds on their error.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    And in recent history there’s been advances
    in symbolically computing the formulas for <em>in</em>definite integrals
    using sufficiently sophisticated symbolic computer algebra systems (CAS).
    You can get a small taste of this sophistication by asking 
    <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>
    to evaluate an integral for you.
</p>
<p>
    Before moving on to applications of integration
    we should address a geometric quirk that we’ve ignored so far,
    but will become crucial to think about
    later when discussing series.
    <em>Unbounded regions <em>may</em> contain 
    a finite amount of area.</em>
    Considering unbounded regions “under” curves 
    and the integrals that compute their area,
    this means our bounds of integration may be \(\pm\infty\),
    or that our curve may have an asymptote (pole)
    between its bounds of integration.
    Such integrals are called <em>improper</em>.
    How do we handle improper integrals computationally? With limits.
    If our bounds of integration are infinite,
    \[
        \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        = \lim_{L\to-\infty}\int\limits_{L}^{0} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        + \lim_{R\to\infty}\int\limits_{0}^{R} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        \,,
    \]
    or if \(f\) has a pole at \(p\) between \(a\) and \(b\),
    \[
        \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        = \lim_{\ell\to p}\int\limits_{a}^{\ell} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        + \lim_{\rho\to p}\int\limits_{\rho}^{b} f(x) \,\mathrm{d}x
        \,.
    \]
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to navigate the nuances of definite integrals
        with bounds \(\pm \infty\),
        or that contain poles within their domain of integration,
        determining whether they converge or diverge,
        and computing their value if they converge.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After going over these techniques
    and becoming comfortable with improper integrals,
    we’ll talk about a few “applications” of integration.
    The first are applications within mathematics,
    specifically within geometry,
    whereas the others are sincere applications,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to write down an integral that computes
        the arclength of a planar curve,
        and be able to write down an integral that computes
        the surface area of a solid generated 
        by revolving a planar region about an axis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        Be able to write down integrals that compute
        the coordinates of the center of mass (centroid)
        of a given planar region.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        Be <em>familiar</em> with other applications of integration
        to biology, economics, and probability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Then since we’re talking about applications of calculus anyways,
    now is a good time to introduce the predominant character 
    of the entire field of applied mathematics: a differential equation.
