    Sometimes the purpose of a course 
    becomes obfuscated over its duration;
    it can become hard to appreciate the overarching plot of a story 
    when one spends months buried in fine exposition
    and occasional side-plots.
    This narrative overview, in its brevity, 
    serves to summarize the plot of this course
    and to clarify our purpose,
    for the sake of keeping both student and instructor 
    focused on what’s important.

<h2>Transcendental Functions</h2>
<p>
    In this second semester of calculus
    we finally come around to introducing the transcendental functions
    \(\ln(x)\) and \(\mathrm{e}^x\).
</p>
<aside>
    Although it should be pointed out, 
    the trigonometric functions sine, tangent, secant, etc,
    are <em>also</em> transcendental functions;
    the designers of most calculus textbooks subtitled “late transcendentals”
    don’t appear to be bothered by this.
</aside>
<p>
    We introduce these functions by <em>defining</em>
    the (natural) logarithm as a definite integral
    \[ \ln(x) = \int\limits_1^x \frac{1}{t}\,\mathrm{d}t\,, \]
    and from there defining \(\mathrm{e}^x\) as \(\ln^{-1}(x)\).
    After starting from this perspective though,
    it becomes pertinent to figure out how the derivative 
    of the inverse of a function relates the function itself.
    Luckily the relationship is quite simple.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Know that the derivative of the inverse of a function 
        can be expressed in terms of the derivative of that function as
        \[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f^{-1}(x) = 
        \frac{1}{f'\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)}\,. \]
        This is known as the <em>inverse function theorem</em>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can get a lot of information from the inverse function theorem,
    not just about the derivative of \(\mathrm{e}^x\)
    and about exponential/logarithmic function of non-natural bases,
    but also about the inverses of trigonometric functions.
    This information adds to our toolbox 
    of differentiation and integrations skills.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to calculate the derivative of 
        any rational sum, product, or composite
        of exponential or logarithmic functions of any base,
        and of inverse trigonometric functions:
        arcsine, arctangent, arcsecant, etc.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be able to calculate the antiderivative 
        of any rational sum of exponential functions, 
        or any antiderivative involving an exponential
        that yields to substitution.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Recognize the patterns of the derivatives
        of logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions
        when they appear as integrands
        so as to calculate integrals when they appear.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Beyond that core thread of new skills, 
    we explore two miscellaneous skills
    that required the language of logarithms 
    to develop in their entirety.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Be familiar with the technique of 
        <em>logarithmic differentiation</em>,
        and know that this technique is essential
        to calculate the derivative of functions of the form
        \(f(x)^{g(x)}\) for non-constant \(f\) and \(g\).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Skill</h4>
        <p>
        Know how and when to apply <em>L’Hospital’s Rule</em>
        to investigate the value of a limit.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before we conclude our exploration of transcendental functions
    and move on to a new chapter of the story,
    there is one last sight we really should see,
    just to say we saw it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Concept</h4>
        <p>
        Be <em>familiar</em> with hyperbolic trigonometric functions:
        what they are, how they relate to exponential functions,
        and what their derivatives and antiderivatives look like.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The addition of these logarithmic, exponential, 
    trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions
    completes the dictionary of differentiable functions
    we’ve been building in this class,
    and so we are now well-prepared to dive into 
    the art and practice of evaluating integrals.
