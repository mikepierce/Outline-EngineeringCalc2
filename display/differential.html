    <li>
        Consider the differential equation

                Show that \(y = 5\ln(x) + 2\)

                to this differential equation.

            <li>
                What is the particular solution 
                to this differential equation
                corresponding to <em>initial conditions</em>
                \(y(1) = 3\) and \(y(\mathrm{e}) = 5\)?

        Consider the differential equation 
        \(\dot{y} = t^2 + 2\cos(t)\).
        <ol>
            <li>

            <li>
                An adult is riding their tricycle along 
                the straight road that passes by their house.
                Their velocity \(\dot y\) (mph) can be modelled by 
                the differential equation \(\dot{y} = t^2 + 2\cos(t)\)
                as a function of \(t\) hours since they left their house.
                If the tricyclist was \(\frac{\pi^3}{24}\) miles from their house
                \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) hours after they left,
                how far will the tricyclist be from their home in \(2\pi\) hours?

<h3> Examples from Stewart</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Determine whether the function \(y = x + \frac 1 x\)
        is a solution to either of the following differential equations.
        \[
        x\dot{y} + y = 2x
        \qquad
        x\ddot{y} + 2\dot{y} = 0
        \]
    </li>
    <li>
        Show that every member of the family of functions
        \[y = \frac{1+c\mathrm{e}^t}{1-c\mathrm{e}^t}\]
        is a solution to the differential equation 
        \(\dot{y} = \frac{1}{2}\left(y^2-1\right)\).
    </li>
    <li>
        Find a solution to the differential equation
        \(\dot{y} = \frac{1}{2}\left(y^2-1\right)\)
        that satisfies the <em>initial condition</em> \(y(0)=2\).
