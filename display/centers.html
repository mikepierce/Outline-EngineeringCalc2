        To the ends of a 6m massless rod 
        are fastened two weights,
        one with mass 2g and another with mass 7g.
        Where is the rod’s fulcrum?
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider a thin straight rod aligned along the \(x\)-axis
        with left-most endpoint at \(x=1\) 
        and right-most endpoint at \(x=7\).
        <ol>
            <li>
                Suppose the rod has uniform density \(\rho.\)
                Where is the rod’s fulcrum?

            <li class="hard">
                Suppose that at a point \(x\) 
                the rod has point-density \(\rho(x) = 1+x^2.\)
                Where is the rod’s fulcrum?

                <h4>Theorem of Pappus</h4>
                Consider the region that would be swept out
                by revolving the rod about the point \(x=0.\)
                What is the area of this region?

        Consider a thin triangular plate, a <em>lamina</em>,
        embedded in the plane such that, for a specific choice 
        of rectangular coordinate system measured in meters,
        the corners of the triangle are located at
        \((1,4)\) and \((7,1)\) and \((7,13).\)
        <ol>
            <li>
                Suppose the lamina has no mass itself,
                buy to its corners are fastened a weights
                with masses 2g, 3g, and 4g respectively.
                Where is the lamina’s center of mass?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the area of the region
                the lamina occupies?
            </li>
            <li>
                Suppose the lamina has uniform density \(\rho.\)
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the mass of the lamina?</li>
                    <li>
                        Where is the lamina’s center of mass?
                        This point, in the case of uniform (constant) density,
                        is called the <em>centroid</em>.

                How would all these previous computations have to change
                if the corner of the lamina located at \((7,13)\)
