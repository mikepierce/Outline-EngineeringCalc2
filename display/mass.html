        There are two weights,

        fastened to the ends of a 10m massless rod.

        Consider a thin straight rod aligned along the \(x\)-axis

<h2> Hydrostatic Pressure </h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        DUMB not a calculus problem
        You toss a small sensor into the ocean.
        The sensor is sealed in a \(1m\times 1m\times1m\) cube
        and is heavy enough to sink.
        A side of this cube is rated to withstand 
        \(!!!\mathrm{kPa}\) of pressure before rupturing
        At what depth should we anticipate 
        that the sensor will be crushed?

    <li>
        (Solution in Stewart)
        A dam approximately has the shape of a trapezoid.
        The height is 20m and the width is 50m at the top 
        and 30m at the bottom. 
        Find the force on the dam due to hydrostatic pressure 
        if the water level is 4m from the top of the dam.
