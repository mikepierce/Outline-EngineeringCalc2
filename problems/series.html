        Every regularly repeating decimal number 
        can be written as a rational number (a fraction).
        For example,
        \[\begin{align*}
            0.\overline{69}
            = 0.696969\dots
            &= 0.69 + 0.0069 + 0.000069 + \dotsb
            \\ &= 69 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^n
            = 69 \left(\frac{1}{100-1}\right)
            = \frac{23}{33}\,.
        \end{align*}\]
        The critical idea behind this calculation 
        is that the “repeating” feature of the number
        can be expressed as a geometric series.
        If the regularly repeating decimal has an initial non-repeating portion,
        you may simply write that initial portion as a fraction,
        and add it back on later.
        For example,
        \[
            4.89\overline{69}
            = 4.20 + 0.\overline{69}
            = \frac{420}{100} + 0.\overline{69}
            = \frac{420}{100} + \frac{23}{33}
            = \frac{808}{165}\,.
        \]
        Using this technique, how do you write 
        \(0.1642857\overline{142857}\) as a rational number?
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Recalling the facts that
        \[\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\arctan(x)
        \qquad\text{and}\qquad
        \frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n\,, \]
        write down a formula for the Maclaurin series of arctangent.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then, recalling that \(\pi = 4\arctan(1),\) 
        write down a series representation for \(\pi.\)
        It should be noted however that 
        since \(1\) is outside the interval of convergence 
        of the Maclaurin series of arctangent, 
        this series only <em>conditionally</em> converges to \(\pi.\)

        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan numbers</a>
        are a sequence of numbers that appear 
        in some counting (combinatorics) problems.
        The first few Catalan numbers are

        write down a formula for the Maclaurin series 
        of the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}.\)

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli numbers</a>

        Consider the following sequence of shapes:
        start with a unit square. 
        Remove its middle ninth square,
        Then remove the middle ninths 
        of the remaining eight squares around that middle one.
        Then remove the middle ninths 
        of <em>all</em> the remaining squares around each of those middle ones,
        and so on.

        A sequence of right triangles are constructed as follows:
        The first triangle has legs of length one,
        and each subsequent triangle has a height of length one
        and has as its base the hypotenuse of the triangle that precedes it.

        Suppose you have a bunch of copies of a single hardback book.
        Imagine stacking them on top of each other, hanging over the edge of a table,
        with each subsequent book hanging further over the edge than the last.
        <figure> <img width="324" src="img/books.png"> </figure>
        What is the smallest number of books you’d have to stack
        before the topmost book is entirely off the table,
        i.e. the left-most edge of the top book is to the right of the table edge?
        (Hint: consider centers of mass.)
        Prove that if you continue stacking books,
        the pile can become arbitrarily far from the edge of the table.

        Construct a sequence of shapes as follows:
        The first shape is an equilateral triangle with unit side-lengths,

        of every edge of the preceding shape.

        Here’s a step-by-step guide to a historical method (1700s)

        John Machin originally used this method in 1706 
        to calculate \(\pi\) accurately to 100 decimal places. 
        This formula, and 
        <a title="Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin-like_formula">other formulas based on it</a>,
        were popularly used to compute \(\pi\) 
        before the age of electronic computers.
        Since the digital age the problem of computing \(\pi\)
        has become the standard problem 
        by which engineers benchmark their super computers.
