        For each of the following curves, 
        come up with a function of \(t\) 
        that expresses the arclength of the curve
        from the \(y\)-axis on the left 
        to the point where \(x = t\) on the right.
        I.e., your initial integral will have bounds \(0\) and \(t\).
        \[
            y = x^2
            \qquad \qquad
            y = \left(1+x^2\right)^{3/2}
            \qquad \qquad
            y = \ln(\sec(x))
        \]
        \[
            y = \mathrm{e}^x + \mathrm{e}^{-x}
            \qquad \qquad
            y = \frac{1}{2}\ln(\sin(2x))
        \]

        Let \(\mathrm{C}\) be the portion of the curve \(y = \sin(x)\)
        between \(x = 0\) and \(x=\frac{\pi}{2}\),
        let \(\mathrm{R}\) be the region bound between \(\mathrm{C}\) 
        and the \(x\)-axis,
        and let \(\mathrm{S}\) be the solid generated 
        by revolving \(\mathrm{R}\) about the \(x\)-axis.

                Write down two different expressions involving integrals

                one using techniques from your first semester of calculus,
                and another using the previous two parts to this question.

                Glance over all these previous integrals 
                and decide which would be reasonable to evaluate 
                and which are difficult or impossible.
                Evaluate the reasonable ones.

        <h4><a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201002/rtx100200220p.pdf">Robert Osserman</a></h4>
        According to a paper published by the AMS,
        the height of Gateway Arch in St Louis, 
        measured in feet, can be modelled by the function
        \[ h(x) = 693.8597 - 68.7672\cosh(0.0100333x) \]
        \(x\) feet from the point below the summit of the arch.
        Note this shape should be called a <em>weighted catenary</em>,
        an altered version of a typical catenary that accounts for 
        the variation in mass along the arch (it’s thinner at the top)
        to maximize structural stability.
        <ol>
            <li> 
                According to this model, 
                what is the length of the Gateway Arch? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Each cross section of the Gateway Arch is a equilateral triangle.
                At the base the side-length of a cross section is \(54\) ft,
                whereas at the top the side-length is \(17\) ft,
                Assuming this length varies <em>linearly</em> 
                from the base to the top, appeal to the Pappus’s Theorem 
                to approximate the volume of the arch
            </li>
        </ol>

        A <em>torus</em> is a “doughnut-shaped” solid.
        Specifically, a torus can be generated by revolving circle 
        \((x-R)^2 + y^2 = r^2\) (for \(R \gt r\)) about the \(y\)-axis.
        <figure> <img width="288" src="img/torus.png"> </figure>
        Note that \(r\) is the radius of its circular cross-section,
        and \(R\) is the distance from the center 
        of the torus’ hole to the center of a circular cross-section.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Calculate a formula for the volume of a torus
                in terms of \(r\) and \(R.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate a formula for the surface area of a torus
                in terms of \(r\) and \(R.\)
            </li>
        </ol>
        Hint: both of these are easy computations
        if you evoke <em>Pappus’s theorem</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The general equation for an <em>ellipse</em>
        centered at the origin with eccentricity 
        is given by the equation
        \[ \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^2 = 1 \,.  \]
        <ol>
            <li>
                Calculate a formula in terms of \(a\) and \(b\)
                for the circumference of an ellipse.
            </li>
            <li>
                Suppose, without loss of generality, that \(a \gt b.\)
                The football-shaped solid formed 
                by rotating such an ellipse about the \(x\)-axis
                is called an <em>oblate spheroid</em>,
                and the lentil-shaped solid formed 
                by rotating such an ellipse about the \(y\)-axis
                is called a <em>prolate spheroid</em>
                Can you calculate formulas 
                for the volume and surface area of these two ellipses?
                Are separate formulas for these two cases necessary?

        <h4>Gabriel’s Horn</h4>
        Sketch the curve \(y = \frac{1}{x}\) for \(x\geq 1\),
        and sketch the surface that results
        from rotating this curve about the \(x\)-axis.
        This surface is popularly referred to as <em>Gabriel’s horn</em>.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Write down an integral that computes
                the surface area of this horn,
                and demonstrate that this integral is divergent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write down an integral that computes
                the volume of the interior of this horn,
                and demonstrate that this integral is convergent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Suppose you pour paint into the horn.
                Since the volume of the interior of the horn is finite,
                you’ll need only finitely much paint to “fill” it.
                But this finite amount of paint would seem to
                coat the entire inner surface of the horn with paint,
                thus painting the horn’s infinite amount of surface
                with finitely much paint. How can this be?

        Archimedes’ Principle states that the buoyant force on an object 
        partially or fully submerged in a fluid 
        is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. 
        Thus, for an object of density \(\rho_0\) 
        floating partly submerged in a fluid of density \(\rho_f\) 
        the buoyant force is given by \(F = \rho_f g \int_{-h}^0 A(y) \,\mathrm{d}y\,,\)
        where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity 
        and \(A(y)\) is the area of a typical cross-section of the object.

        The integrals that appear when computing the arclength of curves

        there is a trick to discovering curves for which
        the arclength is easy to calculate.
