# [Engineering Calc II](https://org.coloradomesa.edu/~mapierce2/136/)

This is the outline of my second semester calculus course,
designed for an audience of prospective engineers.
It’s augmented with links to video lectures, 
notes, exercises, and other educational stuff.
Chapters enumerated with § refer to 
Calculus 9E by Stewart.
