This is the schedule/outline of my ~16 week second-semester calculus course
designed for an class of prospective engineers.
It’s augmented with links to notes, video lectures, 
exercises, demonstrations in Desmos,
and some extra-curricular digressions.
The primary narrative follows 
[*Calculus 9E* by Stewart](https://www.stewartcalculus.com).
